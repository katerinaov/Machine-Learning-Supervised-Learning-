# Mashine Learning/Supervised learning algorythms
This repository contains data science projects with UCI Machine Lerning dataset ['Student Performance'](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)

The algorithms of Supervised Learning were implemented to predict student's performance on their final exams:
1) [Linear Regression](https://github.com/katerinaov/Machine-Learning-Supervised-Learning-/blob/master/Linear%20Regression%20on%20Student's%20Grades%20dataset.ipynb)

2) [Classification problem](https://github.com/katerinaov/Machine-Learning-Supervised-Learning-/blob/master/Classification%20problem%20for%20Student's%20Performance%20dataset.ipynb)
   - Logistic Regression
   - KNeighbors Classification
   - Random Forest classification
   
Please refer the comments in the code.
